# ImageAnalysis

## Project Overview
In this repository I have made several interactive websites using Python and streamlit, so students can experiment with Image processing and Computer vision algorithms used in Image Analysis course at Lund University 

## Algorithms implemented and planned
-Image filters :white_check_mark:
-Histogram Equalization :white_check_mark:
-Graph Cut segmentation :white_check_mark:
-Morphological operations :white_check_mark:
-Harris corner detector :red_circle:

## Technologies Used

- **Main programming language**: Python
- **Computer vision and numerical processing libraries**: `numpy`, `opencv`
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
